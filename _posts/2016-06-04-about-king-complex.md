  The artists behind King Complex, Bracher Brown and Cody Doss, were brought up
  and trained as musicians and songwriters. Their game was changed while waiting
  in line at Bonnaroo 2013 to see Paul McCartney when Bracher overheard someone
  gushing about Pretty Lights. It would be seeing the Pretty Lights show that
  night, and realizing the boundless creativity in electronic music, that
  awakened the entity that is King Complex.  King Complex is an intrepid project
  that recontextualizes organic instrumentation and pop compositional approaches
  with the daring innovations currently happening in electronic music. Their
  first single, “Made In America,” examines the deification of criminals by the
  media through exploring how often in pop culture criminals and rock stars vie
  for the same cover story real estate. The scathing lyrical statement goes down
  easy, offset by raw beats, filthy ambience, hooky glam-rock guitars, ominously
  soulful vocal refrains, and gorgeous soaring lead vocals.   Their self-titled
  EP is a gritty testament to innovative expression. Recorded in their bedroom,
  the duo engineered, produced, and mixed the EP themselves. This sort of
  process allowed for a vast amount of experimentation within every aspect of
  the production. Static covered vocals, dirty bass grooves, and distorted drums
  fill the tracks with an edge often missing from rock music today.
